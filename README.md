Step 5 : Divide the Legit and Fraudulant Transactions 0 ---> Represents Legit Transaction 1 ---> Represents Fraudulant Transacction

Step 6 : Analysis the data by Taking New Variables

Step 7 : Compare the Values of Legit and Fraudulant ( By Comparing Those Values Our Machine Learning Algorithm Understand the Differences Between Legit and Fradulant Trasactions )

Step 8 : Training the Logistic Regression Model with Training Data

Step 9 : Find Accuracy on training data

Step 10 : Find Accuracy on test data
